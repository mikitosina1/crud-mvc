# crud-mvc
my exercise to make sure, that I understand CRUD


I apologize, but so far I can not implement the mvc approach. Poorly familiar with frameworks.


To get started, download the folder from the repository to folder of your local server and import the database with the default values ​​into your local server with help 'myphpAdmin'.
